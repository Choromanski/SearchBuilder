	<![CDATA[
		By default SearchBuilder will automatically redraw the DataTable and apply its search terms on every user input action (e.g. typing or selecting options from a dropdown) - we term this _live searching_. This might not always be desirable, particularly when working with large data sets which can take a significant amount of time to process the search criteria.

		This option can be used to disable the live search operation of SearchBuilder and instead add a _Search_ button to the interface. Triggering of this button will cause the table to perform the search operation setup by the SearchBuilder criteria.

		Please note that with this option enabled if you setup a search, any action that causes the host DataTable to redraw will trigger a search. This includes using the built in global search, ordering or paging.
