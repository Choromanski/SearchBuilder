This option allows for searches not to be triggered until the enter key is pressed when using conditions with input elements. This will happen when `-init searchBuilder.enterSearch` is set to true.

As default this option's value is false, meaning that a search is triggered on every input to an input element.

The only exception to this is when using a date picker. Here selecting a date in the date picker will trigger a search without enter being pressed, regardless of the value of this option.

Take a look at [this example]([../extensions/SearchBuilder/examples/initialisation/enterSearch.html) to see this in action.
