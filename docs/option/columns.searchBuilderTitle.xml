			If a string value is set then SearchBuilder will use that value to refer to the column, rather than using the columns title in the table.

	<default value="undefined">
		The default value of the `-init columns.searchBuilderTitle` is undefined. This means that as standard SearchBuilder will derive a title directly from the columns header.

		<![CDATA[
			This value allows a custom title to be set for any column within SearchBuilder. If a value is set then it will be used to represent the column in the "data" select element. If it is not set then the title of the column will be used instead. In both cases any html that is present will be stripped.
