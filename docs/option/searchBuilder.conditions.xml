		This option is an alias to `-feature searchBuilder.conditions`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchBuilder regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchBuilder`).

		Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchBuilder.conditions` for full details of this option.
