	<summary>Trigger a search on the enter key rather than every keypress</summary>

	<type type="boolean">
		<description>
			When true an enter keypress is required to trigger a search for an input element.

	</type>

	<default value="false">
        The default value for this option is false meaning that as standard a search will occur on every input into an input element.

This option allows for searches not to be triggered until the enter key is pressed when using conditions with input elements. This will happen when `-feature searchBuilder.enterSearch` is set to true.

As default this option's value is false, meaning that a search is triggered on every input to an input element.

The only exception to this is when using a date picker. Here selecting a date in the date picker will trigger a search without enter being pressed, regardless of the value of this option.

Take a look at [this example](/extensions/SearchBuilder/examples/initialisation/enterSearch.html) to see this in action.

Please note: SearchBuilder 1.2.0 coincided with the release of DataTables 1.11.0 which introduced `-init search.return`. This made this option void and it was therefore deprecated. For now this option will continue to be supported, however it will be removed in the future. We encourage you to move instead to `-init search.return`.
