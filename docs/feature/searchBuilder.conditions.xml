	<default value="Object">
		By default, SearchBuilder populates this object with its own predefined search conditions for the various data types built in to DataTables.

	<![CDATA[
		This parameter allows custom conditions to be defined for SearchBuilder (based on data type and the condition itself).

		Note: Please also not that custom conditions are not supported when the `-init serverSide` option is set to true!

		## Examples

		There are two examples that create custom conditions using initialisation options. They both show how to add a custom condition to the `num` column type, but the process is the same for other column types.

		* [Custom Multiple Of](https://datatables.net/extensions/SearchBuilder/examples/customisation/customMultiple.html)
		* [+- 5](https://datatables.net/extensions/SearchBuilder/examples/customisation/customConditions.html)

		There is also an example that shows how to use a plug-in to add a custom condition.
