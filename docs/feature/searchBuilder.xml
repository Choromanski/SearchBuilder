		<description>
			If given as an object, SearchBuilder will be enabled on the target DataTable with the SearchBuilder defaults (`DataTable.SearchBuilder.defaults`) extended, and potentially overwritten by the options provided in this object. This is how SearchBuilder can be configured on an individual table basis, or through the defaults.

	<description>
		SearchBuilder is an extension that presents a user interface for building complex search operations, including grouping logic. 

		SearchBuilder can be enabled through the `-init layout` option with the `searchBuilder` feature name, or the `-button searchBuilder` button, which accepts configuration options as a `config` parameter.

		Please see the _Related_ section below for a list of all configuration options available for SearchBuilder.
