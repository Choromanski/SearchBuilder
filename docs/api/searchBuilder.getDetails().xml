		This method provides the ability to get the details of the data structure and search criteria that is being applied to the DataTable by SearchBuilder's filtering.

		Since version 1.2.0 `-api searchBuilder.getDetails()` takes one optional argument, `deFormatDates`. This is a boolean flag that when true deformats dates down to an ISO 8601 standard. The object that is returned represents all of the groups and criteria that are in place. The object can be passed into the `-api searchBuilder.rebuild()` function to make SearchBuilder reset to the point at which the object was created.

		The object structure is the same as would be used for preDefined searches. Please refer to the `-init searchBuilder.preDefined` documentation for more details on the structure.
